INSTALL HOSPITAL-ENTREPRENEUR

Step 1. Read the README file!

Step 2. REQUIREMENTS:
		* PHP version 5.1.6 or newer
		* MySQL 4.1 or newer
		* A webserver (This is tested on Apache 2.0)

Step 3. Find your favourite text editor, open up the following file:
	/system/application/config/config.php

	Change $config["base_url"] to your webserver location.

Step 4. Find your favourite text editor, open up the following file:
	/system/application/config/database.php

	Change the database settings to fit your database.

Step 5. Deploy the admin_hospital.sql script in your favourite
	MySQL Client. I recommend phpMyAdmin.

Step 6. Open up your website, and create a new temporarily account.
	As I havn't included any users in the basic script.
	You will need to make this one admin by yourself.
	To do so, you have th change the correct security permission.
	I'll let you figure out how you do that :)

Step 7. Everything SHOULD now be working. If it isn't...well...then
	try and google your way through and find the answer.
	I won't answer support requests :)
