Hospital Entrepreneur

:About
Hospital Entrepreneur was meant to be a text based online interactive game, 
based on the popular game Theme Hospital, released by bullfrog studios.

It was created by Arne-Christian Blystad, together with Dale Maison
and Oliver Cross. However, times have changed and the Lead Developer,
Arne-Christian Blystad, myself, have had his priorities changed.

Therefore, the whole Hospital Entrepreneur sourcecode is released to the
general public. The changes I have made is released under the
Creative Commons Attributon 3.0 Unported license. Also Hospital Entrepreneur
is built upon CodeIgniter, which follows its own license. Both are included
in seperate LICENSE files.

You are free to fork and distribute your changes, for both non-commercial
and commercial uses.
